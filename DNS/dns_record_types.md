List of DNS record types

The list of DNS record types is an overview of resource records (RRs) permissible in zone files of the Domain Name System (DNS).

Resource records:

1) A (Address record) - Returns a 32 bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host.

2) AAAA (IPv6 address record) - Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host.

3) MX (Mail exchange record) - Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain.

4) NS (Name server record) - Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers.
